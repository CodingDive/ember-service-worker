_A pluggable approach to Service Workers for Ember.js_

## ðŸš¨ WARNING ðŸš¨

Do not use this in production right now, you will troll your users and they will be unable to use your app.

## Batteries excluded

Without any extra addons all this addon does is install a Service Worker,
but the Service Worker itself will do nothing.
This allows you to craft a set of addons that make the Service Worker function the way you want it to.

## Installation

```
ember install ember-service-worker
```

## Available plugins

- [ember-service-worker-asset-cache](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-service-worker-asset-cache)
- [ember-service-worker-cache-first](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-service-worker-cache-first)
- [ember-service-worker-cache-fallback](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-service-worker-cache-fallback)

## Authoring plugins

To create an Ember Service Worker plugin, you first need to add the
`ember-service-worker-plugin` keyword to the `keywords` option in the plugin's
`package.json`

From within a service worker plugin, you can modify the contents of the generated service worker
(built to `dist/sw.js`) and/or you can modify the mechanism of service worker registration ( built
to `dist/sw-registration.js`).

## Service Worker Tree

Create a `service-worker/index.js` file within in the root of your addon. This file will
automatically be loaded by the created service worker.

Other files in the `service-worker` file are available for `import` via standard ES6 module
semantics.

### API

To make addons simple and pluggable, some middleware has been added.

#### `addFetchListener`

If you want to listen for `fetch` in your addon, you will need to register this
through the `addFetchListener` function. This expects a callback function which
receives the event as argument, just as the callback to
`addEventListener('fetch', ...)` does. It expects the callback to return a
Promise that resolves to a response or `undefined`. If the response is undefined
the next `fetch` handler that has been registered will be called, otherwise the
response from the promise will be used and no further `fetch` handlers will be
called.

Example:

```js
import { addFetchListener } from 'ember-service-worker/service-worker';

addFetchListener(function() {
  // special sauce here
});
```

#### `VERSION`

This is a constant that you can utilize which is updated for every build of the
service worker. You could use this as part of the cache key:

```js
import { VERSION } from 'ember-service-worker/service-worker';

var CACHE_NAME = 'asset-cache-' + VERSION;
self.addEventListener('install', function(event) {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open(CACHE_NAME)
      .then(function(cache) {
        // more stuff here
      })
  );
});
```

## Service Worker Registration Tree

Create a `service-worker-registration/index.js` file within the root of your addon. This file
is required to register the service worker (and its scope).

Other files in the `service-worker-registration` file are available for `import` via standard
ES6 module semantics.

### API

#### `addSuccessHandler`

You can use this method to register a callback to execute after registration is successful.
The callback will be passed the `registration` object.

Example:

```js
import { addSuccessHandler } from 'ember-service-worker/service-worker-registration';

addSuccessHandler(function(reg) {
  // do stuff on successful registration
});
```

#### `addErrroHandler`

You can use this method to register a callback to execute if registration has errored.
The callback will be passed the `registration` object.

Example:

```js
import { addErrorHandler } from 'ember-service-worker/service-worker-registration';

addErrorHandler(function(reg) {
  // do stuff on errored registration
});
```

## Adding Service Worker code directly to your app

It is also possible to add service worker code to your app directly. To do this
add a `service-worker/index.js` or `service-worker-registration/index.js` file to
your project.

This works exactly as authoring plugins.
